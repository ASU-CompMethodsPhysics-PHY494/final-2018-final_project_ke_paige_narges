Complex dynamics in a stratified lid-driven cavity flow

Paige Weisman, Narges, Ke Wu

The dynamic response to shear of a 
fluid-filled square cavity with stable temperature
stratification is investigated numerically. The shear is imposed by a constant
velocity on the top lid, which is quantified by associated Reynolds
number Re=2750. The stratification, quantified by a Richardson number, 
is imposed by maintaining the temperature
of the top lid at a higher constant temperature than that of the bottom, and
the sidewalls are insulating. The Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation
are solved, using a pseudospectral collocation method, over a wide range
of Richardson numbers. Particular attention is paid to the dynamical mechanism associated
with the onset of instability of steady state solutions, and to the complex and
rich dynamics occurring beyond.
